This is a collaborative team project between
Lebene Gbebleou-Sleem and Elizabeth Williams as
partof our ALX SE project for sprint 1

This project creates a unixcommand line interpreter
that waits for a user input.
In all instances, we aim to make our shell emulate
the functions and qualities of the standard shell
